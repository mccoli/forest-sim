# FOREST-SIM
forest scene animation

# about
This is an animation sketch that simulates a springtime forest scene. I created forces such as gravity and wind as PVectors, the latter of which can be manipualted by the user. The wind varies slightly over time by using the noise funtion and an offset.

# design
I chose to simulate a fairly windy day because I found it easier to make it look natural. The user can make it even windier by pressing the 'w' key. I chose to make it blow in the opposite of the original direction because I thought it had a stronger visual response. 

The pixel art style is always fun and quick for me to do, and gave a cutesy feeling to the animation. 

Here are some references I used for the designs:
